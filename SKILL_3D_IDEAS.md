# 🎨 3D Element Ideas for Skills Section

## Option 1: **3D Geometric Shapes**
- Floating cubes/hexagons that connect from the line
- Different shapes per skill (cube for React, hexagon for JS, etc.)
- Minimal, clean, tech-focused

## Option 2: **3D Circuit Nodes**
- Glowing 3D nodes with circuit patterns
- Animated electrical pulses along the connection lines
- Blueprint/circuit board aesthetic

## Option 3: **3D Prisms/Crystals**
- Floating geometric crystals/prisms
- Reflective surfaces with neon glow
- Each skill has unique crystal shape

## Option 4: **3D Holographic Badges**
- Floating badge/medal-like elements
- Holographic shimmer effect
- Tech stack icons as holograms

## Option 5: **3D Energy Orbs**
- Pulsing energy spheres with particles
- Particles flow along connection lines
- Dynamic, energetic feel

## Option 6: **3D Wireframe Nodes**
- 3D wireframe spheres/cubes
- Animated lines connecting points
- Technical, developer aesthetic

## Option 7: **3D Hexagonal Grids**
- Floating hexagon clusters
- Each skill has a unique hex pattern
- Modern, tech-forward look

## Option 8: **3D Floating Text/Numbers**
- 3D skill names floating in space
- Depth effect with glowing outlines
- Minimal, text-focused

## Option 9: **3D Morphing Shapes**
- Shapes that morph between forms
- Smooth transitions between states
- Dynamic, alive feeling

## Option 10: **3D Data Visualizations**
- Mini 3D charts/graphs for each skill
- Bar charts, pie charts in 3D
- Data-driven aesthetic
